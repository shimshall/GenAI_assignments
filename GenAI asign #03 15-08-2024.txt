Assignment #03 Generative AI Fundamentals

Compound AI Systems are sophisticated architectures that combine multiple AI models or components, each specialized in different areas, to perform complex and multifaceted tasks that a single AI model might struggle with alone. Within these systems, AI Agents act as autonomous entities responsible for specific functions, such as perception, decision-making, or action. These agents work together or in parallel within the Compound AI System, contributing their specialized capabilities to achieve the systemâ€™s overall objectives. The integration of AI Agents within Compound AI Systems allows for greater adaptability and functionality, as each agent can focus on a particular aspect of the task. In terms of model enhancement, Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained AI model to a specific domain by further training it on a specialized dataset, enabling the model to better handle domain-specific tasks. On the other hand, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI performance by combining a generation model with a retrieval mechanism that pulls in relevant external data in real time. This allows the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses without needing to alter its internal parameters, offering greater flexibility and up-to-date information handling compared to the static nature of fine-tuning.
