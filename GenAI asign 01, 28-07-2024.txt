Assignment #1 Generative AI Fundamentals


Artificial Intelligence (AI)
----------------------------
- Definition: AI is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, like reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
- Scope: Encompasses various technologies, including rule-based systems, expert systems, and more advanced techniques like ML and DL.
- Examples: Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), game-playing computers (IBM's Watson), autonomous systems (self-driving cars).

Machine Learning (ML)
----------------------
- Definition: ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a task through experience (data) without explicit programming.
- Key Feature: Focuses on building models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions.
- Examples: Spam email filtering, recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), image recognition software.

Deep Learning
-------------
- Definition: Deep Learning is a subset of ML using neural networks with many layers to analyze data. Effective at processing large volumes of unstructured data like images, audio, and text.
- Key Feature: Utilizes neural networks to recognize complex patterns and make predictions.
- Examples: Image recognition (facial recognition), natural language processing (NLP), autonomous vehicles.

Generative AI
-------------
- Definition: Generative AI creates new content, such as text, images, and music, rather than analyzing existing data.
- Key Feature: Uses generative models to produce outputs that are novel and often indistinguishable from human-created content.
- Examples: DALL-E for image generation, ChatGPT for text generation, AI music composers.

Applied AI
----------
- Definition: Applied AI refers to the practical application of AI technologies to solve specific, real-world problems. Focuses on using AI to improve processes, products, or services.
- Key Feature: Implementation-oriented, targeting specific industry challenges.
- Examples: AI for predictive maintenance in manufacturing, fraud detection in finance, personalized marketing in retail.

Summary
-------
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Overarching field mimicking human intelligence.
- Machine Learning (ML): Subset of AI focused on learning from data.
